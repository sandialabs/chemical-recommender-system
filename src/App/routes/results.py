    Processes and displays the results based on user input and application state.

    This function handles both GET and POST requests to the /results route. It processes user-provided weights,
    generates results, and renders the results.html template with the final results.

    Inputs:
    - None directly (uses current_app.state and request.form for input data)

    Application State:
    - state.tarray: An array of boolean values indicating which thermophysical properties are to be calculated.
      The order is:
        - Melting Point
        - Boiling Point
        - Log P
        - Vapor Pressure
        - Henry's Law Constant
    - state.weights: An array of weights corresponding to the importance of each property in tarray.
    - state.queryval: The query value provided by the user.
    - state.results: The initial results to be processed.
    - state.finnum: A parameter used in processing the results.
    - state.params: Additional parameters for generating the final report.
    - state.subfailed: A flag indicating if any subprocesses failed.

    Returns:
    - Renders the 'results.html' template with the following context variables:
        - 'finalresults': The final processed results to be displayed
        - 'tarray': The array of target values from the application state
        - 'weights': The array of weights from the application state
