    <h1>Welcome to the Chemical Recommender System</h1>
    <p>
      The Chemical Recommender System (CRS) is an advanced tool designed to
      assist researchers in identifying and comparing chemical compounds based
      on various criteria such as structural similarity, thermophysical
      properties, and toxicity. Utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning
      models and vector databases, CRS streamlines the process of chemical
      discovery and evaluation, making it a valuable resource for scientific
      research and development. Whether you are looking to find alternatives to
      a known compound, predict the properties of a new molecule, or assess the
      safety of a chemical, CRS provides a comprehensive solution.

      <h3>Preprocessing: Fingerprint-CID Dataset</h3>
      <div class="smallblock">
        <div>
          <p>
            The first step in the CRS involves representing molecules as
            fingerprints. A molecular fingerprint is a 2048-bit long vector
            where each bit is set to on/off to represent the existence of a
            certain structural property. This allows for a quick and
            computationally efficient way of comparing molecules.
          </p>
          <div>
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../static/assets/fingerprint.png"

              />
              <figcaption>
                The above figure describes how features from chemical compounds
                can be taken and represented as specific bits within a
                fingerprint representation.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>
            To facilitate this, we created a comprehensive database of all
            possible candidates and their respective fingerprints using
            high-performance computing (HPC) for mass computation. This process
            is implemented in the by converting PubChem CIDs and SMILES into
            molecular fingerprints using RDKit. The input data for all candidats
            is soruced from
            <a href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/Extras/"
              >PubChem FTP</a
            >. Fingerprints of all known candidates have already been calcuated
            and integrated into the program, so users do not need to run this on
            each query.

      <h3>Running Fingerprint Similarity</h3>
      <div class="smallblock">
        <div>
          <p>
            When running a CRS search, we use done using a vector databasing
            service, called Milvus. Vector Databases allow for the CRS to store
            and manage these fingerprints efficiently. They use indexing methods
            and effective preprocessing to allow for high-speed retrieval and
            comparison of molecular fingerprints, significantly speeding up the
            search process (~20x from conventional step through methods) without
            loss of accuracy. By partitioning the database, we ensure that
            searches are both fast and scalable, handling large datasets with
            ease. This step ensures that only the most relevant candidates are
            considered for further analysis, streamlining the process and
            improving the accuracy of the results.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result of the query is what follows: The process starts by
            finding the query's molecular fingerprint. Then, the vector database
            uses Tanimoto similarity to go through the entire existing database
            from the previous step, finding the fingerprints that match the
            best.
          </p>
          <div>
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../static/assets/tani.png"

              <figcaption>
                Formula for Tanimoto Similarity: Consisting of simple bit
                operations, this is an extremely quick method to screen through
                structural similarity of compounds.

          </div>
          <p>
            As we iterate through searces in each partition, a heap with the
            best candidates are maintained. Finally, a shortlist for similarity
            is created as all the candidates with the highest Tanimoto
            similarities move on for further screening.

      <h3>Thermophysical Comparison</h3>
      <p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px">
        Results are computed by OPERA, and the search allows selection for
        turning on comparison of the following properties: Melting Point,
        Boiling Point, LogP, Vapor Pressure, and Henry's Law Constant.
        Candidates have their value compared against the value of the query,
        which is factored into the similarity score.

    <div class="column">
      <h3>Toxicity Evaluation</h3>
      <p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px">
        This also occurs during the OPERA evaluation. OPERA computes the
        following endpoints for toxicity: Log_BCF, CATMoS_EPA, CATMoS_LD50.
        These values are evaluated and factored into the total similarity score
        for each candidate. A higher value for toxicity decreases the aggregate
        similarity score.

      <p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px">
        Another stage of structural similarity is performed. Here, we also have
        OPERA compute several predicted structural properties of the
        candidates/query. These include the Molecular Weight, Number of Rings,
        Number of Lipinski Failures, Topological Surface Area, and Number of
        Carbons.

        The SA score is computed using a function provided by RDKit. The SA
        score predicts on a scale of 1-10 how difficult it would be to obtain
        the candidate. This can be used as a method of including
        cost-effectiveness in the similarity search. These values for each
        candidate are factored into the similarity score.

      <h3>Integrating Your Own Models</h3>
      <div class="smallblock">
        <div>
          <p>
            CRS allows users to integrate their own machine learning models to
            enhance the chemical comparison process. This is currently only
            available in the CRS CLI version. By specifying the container names
            for your models, CRS will run these models during the comparison
            process and factor their outputs into the similarity score. This
            feature provides flexibility and customization, enabling users to
            tailor the system to their specific needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            To integrate your own models, create a Docker image for your model
            with a Flask API to handle SMILES strings and return computed
            results.

              Example of an added service for the integration in a
              docker-compose.yml file. Note that environment variables set must
              be added in a .env file if used.

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Update the `docker-compose.yml` file to include your Docker image as
            a service. Note that the image and container names should be the
            same, and will be the model name that you provide as a command line
            option. Run the CRS application using Docker Compose, and your model
            will be accessible as part of the CRS application.
          </p>

    <div class="column">
      <h3>Using CRS via CLI</h3>
      <div class="smallblock">
        <div>
          <p>
            The CRS can also be run via the command line interface (CLI). To run
            CRS using CLI, use the `docker-compose.yml` file you used to run
            this webapp. We will use roughly the same steps with some added on
            instructions to access the container as a terminal. Navigate to this
            directory and run the following command:
          </p>
          <pre><code>docker compose up -d</code></pre>
          <p>
            This will start the CRS application, which can be accessed at
            localhost:5005 (or as otherwise specified in .env) in your browser.
            To shut down the application, use the command:
          </p>
          <pre><code>docker compose down</code></pre>
          <p>
            Developers can integrate their own models by entering the container
            shell and using the CLI. Use the following command to enter the
            container shell:
          </p>
          <pre><code>docker exec -it CRS /bin/bash</code></pre>
          <p>
            Add your models through the command line and specify the name of
            your Docker image in the CLI options of CRS to include your model in
            the comparison process. Extensive instructions on how to do so can
            be found in the repository README or with the following line:
          </p>
          <pre><code>python src/main.py -h</code></pre>
